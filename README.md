# Neuron_Safari

Neuron Safari is a novel and (hopefully!) fun way of engaging with Neuroscience using Minecraft. We have constructed a unique world that encompasses an introductory look into basic neuroscience and cellular concepts, using real data! You can explore seven different "zones", each with it's own specific focus. 

This version of the safari has been constructed to be accessible from ages 7+. Some aspects are more difficult to grasp than others, but by including it all in one world we hope that whatever your age, you learn something new from your time in the Safari! 



There are two versions of the world. The "NeuronSafari.zip" file is for the JAVA EDITION of Minecraft. If you are on a Mac, Linux computer, or haven't played Minecraft in a few years but have a copy, this is the version you need. Simply extract the folder into your "saves" folder- see here for where that might be: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/.minecraft



For the vast majority of you, you will need the NeuronSafari.mcworld file, which is for the BEDROCK EDITION. This file works on PC, Android, iOS, etc. This one is quite simple to install. On a computer, just download and double click - it should load automatically! For iPads and iPhones (iOS), or Android (anything not an apple product), follow the instructions in this link: https://www.lifewire.com/download-and-install-minecraft-maps-4163870

Alternatively, you could use the Realms feature (also useful if you want to play on Xbox) https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034754892-Transferring-Minecraft-worlds-to-another-device-
